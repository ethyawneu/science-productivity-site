        <h2 id="heading-inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          Inspiration is a motivational state that is evoked by an external stimulus
          and compels you to act. Scientific studies describe inspiration as having
          three core characteristics: it is <strong>evoked</strong>, not initiated
          volitionally; it involves a sense of <strong>transcendence</strong> as new
          possibilities become vividly apparent; and it generates an
          <strong>approach motivation</strong> to express or actualise that new vision
         【706007025187768†L245-L256】.
        </p>
        <details class="collapsible">
          <summary>How inspiration works</summary>
          <p>
            According to Thrash and Elliot’s tripartite model, inspiration comprises two
            processes. Being <em>inspired by</em> involves recognising the intrinsic value of a
            stimulus—such as a breathtaking sunrise or a powerful idea—and feeling your
            eyes opened to new possibilities【706007025187768†L245-L276】. Being
            <em>inspired to</em> involves the motivational drive to express or implement that
            new vision【706007025187768†L245-L276】. These processes work together: the
            evoking stimulus sustains the inspired state, while the
            approach‑oriented urge pushes you towards action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, inspiration is not itself the origin of creative ideas—it is a
            response to them【706007025187768†L323-L337】. Once you recognise a valuable
            possibility, inspiration mediates between that idea and your subsequent
            actions, motivating you to turn the vision into reality【706007025187768†L292-L305】.

        <h3>Best‑practice tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Expose yourself to diverse stimuli—books, conversations, art or nature—to
            increase opportunities for being inspired.</li>
          <li>Keep an inspiration journal. When something sparks an idea or feeling, jot
            down what evoked it and how you might act on it.</li>
          <li>Use inspiration deliberately: once inspired, identify a small step you can
            take to begin realising your vision.</li>

      <!-- Motivation Section -->
      <section id="motivation" class="section" aria-labelledby="heading-motivation">
        <h2 id="heading-motivation">Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Motivation drives behaviour by providing a reason to act. Two broad types of
          motivation have been identified. <strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> arises from
          internal needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness【414999437146836†L253-L260】.
          <strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> relies on external incentives or rewards and
          is governed by cost–benefit calculations【414999437146836†L273-L288】. In practice,
          most goal pursuit involves a blend of both types, but intrinsic motivation
          tends to sustain engagement better over time.
        </p>
        <details class="collapsible">
          <summary>Digging deeper</summary>
          <p>
            Self‑determination theory posits that people are most motivated when they feel
            autonomous (acting out of free choice), competent (capable of success) and
            connected to others【414999437146836†L253-L260】. Extrinsic models, such as
            reinforcement learning and cost–benefit analyses, highlight the role of
            rewards and punishments【414999437146836†L273-L288】. However, over‑reliance on
            external incentives can undermine intrinsic motivation and lead to
            short‑lived behaviour change【414999437146836†L336-L347】.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early psychological models emphasised will and intention (Lewin, Tolman),
            while economic models conceptualise motivated choice as a calculation of
            benefits versus costs【414999437146836†L273-L295】. A balanced approach to
            motivation recognises that goals should align with personal values and
            provide meaningful rewards, while also considering external constraints and
            incentives.

        <h3>Best‑practice tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Set goals that satisfy your need for autonomy, competence and connection.</li>
          <li>Use external rewards sparingly and strategically—for example, to kick‑start a
            behaviour—but avoid letting them replace internal reasons for action.</li>
          <li>Reflect on why a goal matters to you personally; intrinsic meaning helps
            sustain motivation.</li>

      <!-- Intention Section -->
      <section id="intention" class="section" aria-labelledby="heading-intention">
        <h2 id="heading-intention">Intention</h2>
        <p>
          Forming a clear intention bridges the gap between wanting to do something and
          actually doing it. Implementation intentions are “if‑then” plans that specify
          when, where and how to act—for example, “If it is 6 pm on Monday, then I will
          jog in the park.” Meta‑analytic evidence shows that creating such plans
          dramatically improves goal attainment (effect size d≈0.65 across 94 studies)【254798157386042†L228-L243】.
        </p>
        <details class="collapsible">
          <summary>How implementation intentions help</summary>
          <p>
            Implementation intentions increase the mental accessibility of the critical
            cue (the “if” part) and forge a strong association between the cue and the
            desired action【254798157386042†L245-L253】. This strategic automation means
            that when the specified situation arises, the behaviour is triggered
            immediately and efficiently, without requiring further deliberation【254798157386042†L245-L257】.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gollwitzer and Sheeran’s meta‑analysis demonstrates that implementation
            intentions benefit individuals and groups across domains, from health
            behaviours to academic tasks【254798157386042†L228-L243】. The key is
            specificity: vague plans like “exercise more” do little to change behaviour.

        <h2 id="heading-habits">Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Habits are automatic behaviours triggered by cues in our environment. They form
          when we repeat an action consistently in the same context, strengthening the
          association between context and behaviour. In one study, daily repetition of
          a health‑promoting behaviour led to an asymptotic increase in automaticity
          that plateaued after about 66 days【371555136634746†L228-L241】. Missing an
          occasional repetition did not halt the process【371555136634746†L228-L241】.
        </p>
        <details class="collapsible">
          <summary>Phases of habit formation</summary>
          <p>
            Habit formation begins with the <strong>initiation phase</strong>, in which you
            choose a specific behaviour and the context in which to perform it【371555136634746†L263-L272】. The
            <strong>learning phase</strong> follows: repeating the action in the chosen
            context builds the cue–behaviour association. Finally, during the
            <strong>stability phase</strong>, the behaviour requires minimal effort and becomes
            part of your routine【371555136634746†L263-L272】.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simpler actions become habitual more quickly than complex routines, and
            progress resumes even if you occasionally miss a repetition【371555136634746†L228-L241】.
            Selecting a self‑determined, meaningful behaviour and linking it to a
            consistent cue are key to success【371555136634746†L243-L259】.

        <h3>Best‑practice tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a simple action that moves you toward your goal and perform it daily in
            response to the same cue.</li>

        <p>
          Discipline enables you to persist in the face of temptations and setbacks.
          Psychological research distinguishes between <strong>self‑control</strong>—the
          ability to regulate attention, emotion and behaviour in the presence of
          temptation—and <strong>grit</strong>—the passion and perseverance to pursue a
          long‑term superordinate goal【664687497731561†L187-L203】. High self‑control early in
          life predicts later academic achievement, prosocial behaviour, employment,
          earnings and health【664687497731561†L187-L203】, while grit predicts the completion
          of challenging long‑term goals such as graduating high school, finishing
          military training and remaining in demanding professions【664687497731561†L223-L256】.

          <summary>Self‑control vs grit</summary>
          <p>
            Self‑control and grit are related but distinct. Self‑control involves
            resisting hourly temptations and aligning your actions with any valued goal
            despite more alluring alternatives【664687497731561†L187-L203】. Grit entails
            staying committed to one high‑level, long‑term goal through adversity and
            over years or decades【664687497731561†L223-L256】. Self‑control is linked to
            everyday functioning (e.g. grades and health), whereas grit predicts
            exceptional achievements【664687497731561†L263-L274】.
