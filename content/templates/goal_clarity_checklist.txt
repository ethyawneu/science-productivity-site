Goal‑Clarity Checklist
======================

Use this checklist to refine your goals and enhance intrinsic motivation.

- [ ] **Purpose** – Why do I want to achieve this goal? Does it align with my values and interests?
- [ ] **Outcome** – What will success look like? How will my life be different?
- [ ] **Competence** – Do I feel capable of achieving this goal? What skills or knowledge do I need to develop?
- [ ] **Autonomy** – Am I pursuing this goal by choice rather than due to external pressure?
- [ ] **Relatedness** – Who can support me? How does this goal connect me with others?
- [ ] **Rewards** – Are there appropriate external incentives? Will they undermine my intrinsic motivation?
- [ ] **Milestones** – Can I break the goal into smaller milestones with their own deadlines?

Review your responses and adjust your goal accordingly. Goals that satisfy autonomy, competence and relatedness tend to sustain motivation longer.
