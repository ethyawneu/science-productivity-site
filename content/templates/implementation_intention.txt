Implementation‑Intention Template
================================

Follow these steps to create an effective implementation intention:

1. **Identify your goal.**
   - Example: “I want to finish reading a research article each week.”

2. **Choose a clear cue (when/where).**
   - When will you perform the action? (e.g. “Every Tuesday and Thursday at 7 am”)
   - Where will you be? (e.g. “At my desk”) 

3. **Specify the action (how).**
   - Describe exactly what you will do when the cue occurs. (e.g. “I will read one section of the article for 20 minutes.”)

4. **Write your if‑then plan.**
   - “If it is [cue], then I will [action].”

5. **Make it visible.**
   - Keep your plan where you will see it (calendar reminder, sticky note, etc.).

Example implementation intention:

If it is 7 am on Tuesday or Thursday and I am at my desk, then I will read one section of my selected article for 20 minutes.
