Discipline Planner
==================

Use this planner to strengthen your self‑control and grit.

1. **Long‑term goal:**
   - Define a single overarching goal you are passionate about. (e.g. “Run a marathon by next spring.”)

2. **Sub‑goals:**
   - Break the long‑term goal into smaller, time‑bound sub‑goals. (e.g. “Run 10 km comfortably by October.”)

3. **Temptations and obstacles:**
   - List common temptations or obstacles that could derail your progress. (e.g. “Skipping runs when it rains.”)

4. **Implementation intentions for obstacles:**
   - For each obstacle, write an if‑then plan to maintain self‑control. (e.g. “If it is raining, then I will run on the treadmill at the gym.”)

5. **Progress tracking:**
   - Record your efforts and reflect on how you handled temptations each week.

6. **Celebrate milestones:**
   - Plan small rewards or celebrations for achieving sub‑goals to sustain motivation.

Use this planner regularly to stay aligned with your vision, handle distractions and persevere through challenges.
